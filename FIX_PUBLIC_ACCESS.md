# ðŸ”“ Fix Public Access Issue

## Problem: Marketing site asks for sign-in

This happens when Vercel project has authentication enabled. Here's how to fix:

## Solution 1: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select `baby-raffle-marketing` project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **General**
4. Scroll to **Password Protection** section
5. Make sure it's **DISABLED** (should show "Off")

## Solution 2: Check Function Protection
1. In same Settings â†’ **Functions**
2. Ensure no authentication is required
3. Check **Environment Variables** - remove any auth-related vars that shouldn't be there

## Solution 3: Re-deploy (Already Done)
âœ… I just redeployed with a clean `vercel.json` config that removes any auth requirements.

## Testing:
Try visiting these URLs in an incognito browser:
- https://baby-raffle-marketing-cvbkoyq32-slimhindrances-projects.vercel.app
- https://babyraffle.base2ml.com (if DNS is configured)

## SSL Certificate Status:
âœ… Vercel is automatically creating SSL for `babyraffle.base2ml.com` - this means your DNS is working!

## Next Steps:
1. Test the new deployment URL above
2. If still shows auth, check Vercel dashboard settings
3. Once DNS propagates fully, `https://babyraffle.base2ml.com` will be live

The marketing site should now be publicly accessible without any sign-in requirement.
